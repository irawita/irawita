I am Aditya Tiwari, a 20 year old from Bangalore, Karnataka. I am a physics and mechanical engineering major at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. This website is my platform to share photographs of my life, and to discuss music, technology, and society. 

You can tune into my radio station (which is also BITS Pilani's semi-official college radio) here.
