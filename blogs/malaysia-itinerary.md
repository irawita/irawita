Kuala Lumpur is a nice place.

### Live Fact

I pulled up to KL on a Sunday, so there's a lot of music I ended up missing out on. I did find this place called Live Fact, which is a little studio/venue in Petaling Jaya. It's pretty intimate, and appears to be the spot for the local shoegaze scene. I got to see Commemorate's album showcase, opened by Aurum, Feral and Suur. Pedal-laced walls of sound do get pretty repetitive (especially for a show that goes on for over 3 hours), but I suppose that isn't really news. Good vibes, nice people, and solid music. There didn't appear to be a kitchen or anything in there (there was some kind of pantry but I wouldn't really call the place a diner) so don't go on an empty stomach. 

### Amcorp Mall

This isn't a mall in our sense of the word. Think Palika Bazaar, except it's 50% record, comics and collectibles stores + not sketchy. This place alone would make KL worth coming back to, considering that I haven't found anything of the like back home. 5-15RMB (₹100-300) CDs, 10-20RMB vinyls, and similarly cheap cassettes. I didn't go with the mindset to truly Consume, so I just got a handful of no-name CDs. Sort out a bucket list of whatever physical media/otaku shit you want before you come here. There's also (at least one) really dope antiques store, picrel so you can orient yourself a little before coming. Cool place, absolutely would recommend. 

### Petronas Twin Tower

This place is for the vibes. There isn't much to do as such, unless you're rich enough to transcend price-consciousness. The shops here are pretty much there only for brand-positioning. The only activity is a tour to the bridge between the towers — you have to book tickets for it, and make sure to book them BEFORE you go there, it is usually overbooked. The tour itself is pretty nice, albeit at a steep price (100RM). 

### Chinatown (Petaling Street)

Avoid it. The market itself has precisely the quality of goods you'd find at Palika, and at similar prices. There's also no interesting goods, mostly typical knockoff-branded clothes and other mass-market stuff.  

### KL Butterfly Park

Great place. It's a little greenhouse that's very nicely landscaped, and hosts a bunch of butterflies (and other bugs, but they're in enclosures if having bugs free roam bothers you). The entry fee is 60RM or something like that. Ask for a student discount, I forgot to so I'm not sure if there is one. 

### Islamic Arts Museum

This museum is in walking distance of the butterfly park (matter of fact, most of the places I mention here have the same closest train station, Pasar Seni). 20RM entry, 10 for students — don't leave your ID card at home. Highly recommend. Lots of ancient Quranic manuscripts, Persian (and other) illuminated miniatures and other Islamic relics. There's a gift/book store too. 

### Petai Balalang

Full-house grindcore on a Tuesday fucking night. Small scene venue where everyone knows everyone. I have accepted that we Asians cannot mosh. Saw Tools and _.  This place also doesn't serve anything (they have an amateurish drinks counter much like Live Fact), so go with a full stomach or bring whatever you want with you.  Sovl place, make sure to drop by. 

### Guru Nanak Darbar Tatt Khalsa Diwan Gurdwara

It's a pretty nice Gurudwara. Kirtan is at 6.30am and 7pm (not sure about the latter). They don't serve Langar on Wednesdays, and that's when I visited. There isn't a lot more to say about the place, I suppose. The nearby area is interesting to walk through. 



I intend to visit KL again, so I'll keep updating this. Flights are cheap, and you don't need a visa. The city is thoughtfully built and pleasant to walk through. 



## Places I didn't visit but seem cool

Let me know if you visit these, even better if you can write a few details. 

### Cash Converters

Chain used goods store. Had I a little more time to plan my trip, I'd have had a list of audio equipment I wanted to score. 

### REXKL

Hipster art venue.
